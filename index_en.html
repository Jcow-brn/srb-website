                            American choreographer Martha Graham and Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. It is based on
                            the article &ldquo;Spiral as Form in Time,&rdquo; published in 2023 in the Moscow scientific
                            journal &ldquo;Young Scientist - Promising Science.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lesson + Master

                            academic approach and practical application of what has been said.</p>

                                The seminar for teachers of Serbian as a foreign language called &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;
                                is a unique event, which stands out, first of all, for its concept: participation in the
                                seminar is free, since the main idea is the so-called <strong>skill swap</strong>: each
                                participant shares with colleagues a specific grammar problem that he encounters in his
                                teaching practice, and in return offers one of his &ldquo;cases&rdquo;, i.e. a case
                                study in which he successfully solved another problem.</p>

                                through the exchange of advice to foster collegiality and connection with other
                                professionals in the same field. Both philologists and those who have not completed
                                their academic education but have teaching experience can take part in the seminar. To
