                                playwright Luka Kuryachki took place. The play &quot;Bugistan - Cancer Surgery in Three
                                Acts&quot; talks about the experience that the playwright himself went through: surgery
                                to remove a brain tumor. By creating a separate language based on real aphasia, the
                                author takes us through an entire fictional world - Bugistan, in which we reflect and
